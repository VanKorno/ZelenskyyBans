## This is where Zelenskyy bans Orthodox Christianity FOR REAL:

```Kotlin
class Zelenskyy() {
  init {
    ban(OrthodoxChristianity)
    ban(NoodlesForPastafarians)
  }
}
```



Now russian fascist sympathisers (like Anna Paulina Luna) have a place where they can come and see Zelenskyy banning Orthodox Christianity. They won't be able to find it in the Ukrainian laws, in any official documentation, on the official websites, but here, on this GitHub page the Zelenskyy class clearly calls the banning function to ban the shit out of OrthodoxChristianity.

Checkmate!

Iron proof right here, on GitHub!
