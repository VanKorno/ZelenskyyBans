# ZelenskyBansChr
## This is where Zelensky bans Orthodox Christianity FOR REAL:

```Kotlin
class Zelensky() {
    init {
        ban(OrthodoxChristianity)
        ban(NoodlesForPastafarians)
    }
}
```

Now russian fascist sympathisers (like Anna Paulina Luna) have a place where they can come and see Zelensky banning Orthodox Christianity. They won't be able to find it in the Ukrainian laws, in any official documentation, on the official websites, but here, on this GitHub page the Zelensky class clearly calls the banning function to ban OrthodoxChristianity.
Checkmate!
Iron proof right here, on GitHub!
